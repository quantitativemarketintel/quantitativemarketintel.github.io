### Step 1: Setting up your environment
Follow the [QMI environment setup guide]({{site.url}}/assets/UpdatedEnvironmentSetup.pdf) to install dependencies and get you ready to code! 


### Step 2: Additional GitHub things 
Message me (Jessica) to get access to the [QMI2020 GitHub repo](https://github.com/QuantitativeMarketIntelligence/QMI2020). We'll be part of a GitHub organization, so you'll be able to add to this repo, as well as create your own. Then, go to your GitHub account and push something to the QMI GitHub repo in the ```/welcomeback``` folder (it can be anything - a text file, a funny meme, etc).

#### Git Recap:
```
$ git clone <repo link>
$ cd QMI2020/welcomeback // access welcomeback folder
$ git add . 		// use this to add all new files
$ git commit -m "your message here"
$ git push
```

### Step 3: Fill out poll
Fill out [this poll](https://tiny.cc/QMIWelcomeBack) on what you still need to review from last year. It will help Rahul and me to fine tune the curriculum for this year. :)
